## Technology
This project is dependent on business logic rather than performance or a unified technology across the back-end and front-end. Additionally, the number of users is not expected to be very large. Typical users do not expect high performance, and the volume of data is low. It is important that the source code is easily understandable for non-professional software engineers. As a result, .NET/C# has been chosen over Node.js/JavaScript. For the same reasons mentioned earlier, Blazor Server has been chosen over a solution involving separate back-end and front-end. Blazor Server provides the comfort of ASP.NET MVC but is still perceived as a single-page application (SPA) by end users.
